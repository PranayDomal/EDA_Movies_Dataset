## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Key steps performed:

* Removed unnecessary columns
* Converted ISO language codes → Full language names
* Split `Genre` column into lists and used `explode()` for analysis
* Converted `Genre` into `category` dtype for memory efficiency
* Verified duplicates and missing values (none found)
* Standardized column types
